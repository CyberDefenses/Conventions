It stands for (C)onstellation (H)istory (R)eputation (I)ntent (M)alware (E)xecution and is aimed at rapidly helping an analyst turn data into linked, correlated and context infused information that can be profiled and analyzed into intelligence. Students are challenged to take on the role of an intelligence analyst and work through several scenarios using the CHRIME technique.

 
## THREE STEP YARA 
(Friday 23 Feb 18 | 1:00-4:30 PM)  with Monty St. john, Director of Intelligence @MontyStJohn workshop provided by  @CyberDefenses

A gentle introduction to the simple but powerful art of using YARA to find patterns in data. YARA is the pattern matching king of analysis tools, compatible with nearly every platform out there, open source and built in C. If it’s not in your trusted tool set for incidents and intelligence work – it should be. In this 3-hour workshop, students are introduced to and then use YARA to interrogate files and pull out the information they need. This is not a how-to rule building class but a hands-on usage workshop.
